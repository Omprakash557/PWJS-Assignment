5.	What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?

Ans :

All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.

HTML <!DOCTYPE> tag is used to inform the browser about the version of HTML used in the document. It is called as the document type declaration (DTD).

Technically <!DOCTYPE > is not a tag/element, it just an instruction to the browser about the document type. It is a null element which does not contain the closing tag, and must not include any content within it.

In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:

<!DOCTYPE html>

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT case sensitive.

Let's see an example of HTML document with doctype declaration.

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
<title>This is the title</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
This is the content of the document.  
</body>  
</html>
