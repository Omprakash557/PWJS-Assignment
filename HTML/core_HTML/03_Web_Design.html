    <h1>Web Design </h1>

    <p>Web designers keep themselves busy with everything that has to do with the aesthetics of a website. Besides that,
        usability and user experience while designing are equally as important, if not more important. Web designers
        don’t just ‘design,’ they have to think about a lot of things during the process. A few of those things are the
        current trends, the design norms and foremostly, the target audience behavior. It’s not just about what’s
        appealing to the eye. In most cases, it’s more about what kind of designs will help trigger the right actions
        from visitors. And when all that is researched and analyzed, the design has to match the branding of the company
        in question as well.</p>

    <p> So, it goes without saying that being a web designer is as much about designing as it is about psychologically
        understanding what you’re designing and making sure it will do what’s expected from it. It’s an addition to
        great company branding and helps create another funnel for companies.</p>

    <p>A web designer usually handles the first stage of creating a website. They think about what a website needs and
        how it needs to be set up. This information is vital when being passed on to a web developer.</p>
