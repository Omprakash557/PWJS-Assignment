    <h1>Web Devlopment</h1>

    <p>Web Developer A web developer contributes to the second stage of creating a website. When the entire structure
        and expectations are set, a web developer can start putting things into practice. And even here, you can have
        different types of web developers as well. When hiring or becoming a web developer, you can take your pick
        between these three options: </p>

    <p>Frontend Developer – If you’re hiring a frontend developer, they will take charge of the way your website looks.
        The main languages that are used by frontend developers are HTML, CSS and Javascript. Some work with CMS
        platforms as well where they can take care of the frontend of a website using themes and builders. In this case,
        a lot of the coding work is taken out of hands but knowledge of CSS, in particular, is still required to be able
        to make tweaks whenever needed.</p>

    <p>Backend Developer – A backend developer, on the other hand, takes care of the backend of a website. Making
        everything work functionally is the main priority. Backend developers have very code-intensive days and need to
        make everything work with the frontend of a website. Often, this includes making an eCommerce website work or
        have membership websites up and running.</p>

    <p>Full Stack Developer – Full stack developers are the best of both worlds. They take care of both the backend and
        frontend of a website. In many cases, this makes the workflow easier.</p>
